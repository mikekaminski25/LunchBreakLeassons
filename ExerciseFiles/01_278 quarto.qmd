## What Is Quarto?

First there was **markdown** (filename.md). It is a lightweight markup language.

Then **R-Markdown** (filename.rmd). Markdown with the ability to include code and results. Originally just for R, then included python, SQL, and other languages. Considered a notebook similar to jupyter, IPython. [Everything about rmd](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com)

Now **Quarto**. (filename.qmd). Next generation RMD. [Everything about Quarto](https://quarto.org/)
